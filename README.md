# CSE264_Final_Project
Movie Watchlist app created by sph325 and lpb325 for CSE264 final project

## Project Overview (Name, description, purpose)
### Movie Watchlist - Sean Hazard (sph325) and Luke Burns (lpb325)
For this project, we are using the OMDb and a custom frontend to allow users to create their own personal movie watchlists.

## Team Members & Roles
Sean Hazard - sph325@lehigh.edu  
Luke Burns - lpb325@lehigh.edu

# Application Features (How it meets each requirement)
## User Accounts & Roles: Implement different user roles such as user/admin, free/paid, etc.
Users can create an account to log in and store their watchlist. A basic user can manage his/her own watchlist, while an admin can manage other users' data and flag content.

## Database: Your application must store and retrieve data from a database of your choice.
The database will store user profiles with basic info about a user (name, email, age, etc.) as well as movie watchlist data for each user. Internal REST routes will allow for searching, adding/removing movies from a watch list, and profile edits.

## Interactive UI: Your web app must have an interactive user interface, which can include forms, real-time updates, animations, or other dynamic elements.
The interactive UI will include search features, clear formatting of movie choices to add to one's list with movie posters and titles, and a view of a user's current list.

## New Library or Framework: You must use at least one library or framework that was not covered in class.
We will use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth) for our authentication (admin/user).

## Internal REST API: Your project must have an API layer used to store and retrieve data
Internally, we can use REST routes to see a users profile, edit their profile, etc.

## External REST API: You may include an external REST API (e.g., Reddit API, Spotify API, OpenWeather API, etc.).
Externally, we will use the [Open Movie Database (OMDB)](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movie titles, posters, and information.

## Installation & Setup Instructions (How to install, run, and configure the application)
TBD. Will update after codebase is started and templates are released by Prof. Onimus.

## API Keys & Database Setup (What environment variables or external configurations are needed)
TBD.
